# 3D-Model-Viewer
A simple 3D model viewer I built for an academic assignment in Graphics I. Written in C++ using Win32/OpenGL. Loads Wavefront OBJ files. Includes transforming, texturing, back-face culling, simple lighting. and wire-frame rendering, as well as the GUI framework.

Some files are named strangely to prevent conflicts with the GUI framework.
